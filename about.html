	<span id="inner-title">The story behind the quote...</span>
	<p> <img src="John_Muir.png" id=johnMuirImg alt="Photo of John Muir">
     The famous quote "The mountains are calling and I must go" that displays on every webpage came
    from a famous writer and outdoorsman by the name of
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Muir" target="_blank">John Muir</a>, who is regarded as
    one of the "Fatherâ€™s of our National Parks" in the USA. This specific quote is from a letter to
    his sister describing his recent trip in the mountains in a very poetic fashion. This quote has
    become very well-known as a trademark for people living in the Sierra Nevada, Appalaichan, Blue
    Ridge, and Rocky mountain ranges. <br> <br>
     In terms of this website, it is no more than a silly pun that is used to link the mountains
      to a contact manager, because when someone calls, you want to know who's calling you! </p>
